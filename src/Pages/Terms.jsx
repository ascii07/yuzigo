        </p>
        <p style={styles.section}>

          YUZI GO Fantasy offers three variations in contests:
          <ul style={styles.list}>
            <li><strong>Guaranteed Contests:</strong> As the name suggests, guaranteed contests offer guaranteed winnings and will not get cancelled, even if they do not meet the participant requirements/spots.</li>
            <li><strong>Flexible Contests:</strong> In flexible contests, there should be at least 3 users and a maximum of 100 users in the contest. If there are two users in the flexible contest, the respective contest will be converted into head-to-head. The flexible contests will get cancelled, if the contest receives less than 50% participation. For instance, if a flexible contest has a total of 20 spots and 8 users join the contest, this contest will be cancelled. For this flexible contest to carry on, a minimum of 10 users are required to join.</li>
            <li><strong>Guaranteed + Flexible Contests:</strong> Users will also find flexible + guaranteed contests. In these contests, league price and winning is varied depending on the number of users joining the contest. This contest will not get cancelled, irrespective of number of users joining the contest.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p style={styles.section}>

        <h2 style={styles.subHeader}>10. Legality of Game of Skill</h2>
        <p style={styles.section}>
          The legality of games of skill, such as those offered on fantasy sports platforms, has been established by Indian gambling legislation and court decisions. The Public Gambling Act of 1867 does not apply to games of skill and in 2020, the Haryana High Court dismissed a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) by Ravindra Singh Chaudhary that questioned the legality of playing fantasy sports. The Court held that fantasy sports, as a game of skill where fees are paid to compete for prizes, are a legitimate business protected by Article 19(1)(g) of the Indian Constitution, which guarantees the right to engage in an occupation, trade or business.
        </p>
        <p style={styles.section}>
          The Contest/(s) offered as the features are considered games of skill as their outcome depends on the participant’s knowledge of the games of cricket, football, kabaddi, volleyball, basketball, hockey, handball, rugby, baseball, US football and players, their attention to the Contest and their ability to make strategic decisions. The success of participants depends on factors such as their knowledge of the statistics of the games, the form of the players and the conditions of the match. Participants are required to field well-balanced teams with available resources and make substitutions at appropriate times to earn maximum points.
        </p>
        <p style={styles.section}>
          By participating in these Contest/(s), each Participant acknowledges and agrees that they are participating in a game of skill.
        </p>
        <p style={styles.section}>
          More about the legality of YUZI GO Fantasy can be found at the website of the All India Gaming Federation (AIGF): www.aigf.in.

        <h3 style={styles.subSubHeader}>26.2 TDS</h3>
        <p style={styles.section}>
          According to the new section 194BA of the Income-tax Act, 1961, starting from 1st April 2023, a 30% withholding tax (‘TDS’) will be applied to the positive “Net Winnings” earned by Users from online games on YUZI GOFantasy.
        </p>
        <p style={styles.section}>
          TDS will be triggered:
          <ul style={styles.list}>
            <li>At the time of withdrawal throughout the year, or</li>
            <li>At the end of the Financial Year i.e. 31st March</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p style={styles.section}>
          Net Winnings will be calculated using the following formula:
          In this case, Net Winnings of a User will be calculated as:
          <br />Net Winnings = A – B – C – D, where,
          <br />A = Aggregate withdrawals from the user account
          <br />B = Aggregate amount deposited in the user account during that period
          <br />C = Opening Balance in the user account at the beginning of the financial year (Winning + Unutilised Deposit)
          <br />D = Winnings included from earlier withdrawals on which TDS has already been deducted
        </p>
        <p style={styles.section}>
          For easier understanding, please refer to the following examples:
        </p>
        <p style={styles.section}>
          <strong>Example 1) TDS Deduction on 1st Withdrawal:</strong>
          <br />A User has an opening wallet balance of ₹2,000 at the beginning of the financial/fiscal year and hasn’t deposited any amount in the YUZI GOFantasy wallet. The user uses the existing balance to participate in fantasy contests and has accumulated winnings of ₹10,000. Now the user requests a withdrawal of ₹4,000, then the User’s account has the following details:
          <br />Requested withdrawal from the user, A = ₹4,000
          <br />The amount deposited in the user account during the year, B = 0
          <br />Opening balance in the user account, C = ₹2,000
          <br />Winnings from earlier withdrawals on which TDS has been deducted, D = 0
          <br />Then, Net Winnings = A – B – C – D
          <br />Net Winnings = 4,000 – 0 – 2,000 – 0
          <br />Net Winnings = ₹2,000
          <br />TDS on this withdrawal will be calculated as follows:
          <br />TDS = 30% of Net Winnings
          <br />TDS = 0.30 * Net Winnings
          <br />TDS = 0.30 * 2,000
          <br />TDS = ₹600
          <br />Amount credited to Bank Account = Requested Withdrawal Amount (A) – TDS
          <br />Amount credited to Bank Account = ₹4,000 – ₹600
          <br />Amount credited to Bank Account = ₹3,400
        </p>
        <p style={styles.section}>
          In simpler terms, the User has requested to withdraw ₹4,000 from their winnings. After considering the account balance and deposits, the Net Winnings amount to ₹2,000. YUZI GOFantasy will withhold 30% of the Net Winnings as TDS, which is ₹600 in this case. The final amount credited to the User’s registered bank account would be ₹3,400.
        </p>
        <p style={styles.section}>
          <strong>Example 2) TDS Deduction on Following Withdrawals:</strong>
          <br />Let’s say that the same User has deposited ₹2,000 in their in-app wallet. The user now requests another withdrawal of ₹5,000. In this case:
          <br />Total withdrawal amount requested, A = ₹4,000 (earlier withdrawal amount) + ₹5,000 (new withdrawal amount)
          <br />Total amount deposited by the user, B = ₹2,000
          <br />Opening balance of the financial year, C = ₹2,000
          <br />Withdrawals on which TDS has been deducted, D = ₹2,000
          <br />Then, Net Winnings = A – B – C – D
          <br />Net Winnings = (₹4,000 + ₹5,000) – ₹2,000 – ₹2,000 – ₹2,000
          <br />Net Winnings = ₹9,000 – ₹6,000
          <br />Net Winnings = ₹3,000
          <br />TDS on this withdrawal will be calculated in the following manner,
          <br />TDS = 30% of Net Winnings
          <br />TDS = 0.30 * Net Winnings
          <br />TDS = 0.30 * 3,000
          <br />TDS = ₹900
          <br />Amount credited to Bank Account = Requested Withdrawal Amount – TDS
          <br />Amount credited to Bank Account = ₹5,000 – ₹900
          <br />Amount credited to Bank Account = ₹4,100
        </p>
        <p style={styles.section}>
          The User has made two withdrawals that sum up to ₹9,000 from their winnings during the year. After considering the account balance, deposits and previous withdrawals, user’s Net Winnings amount to ₹3,000. After the TDS deduction, ₹4,100 will be credited to the registered bank account of the user.
        </p>
        <p style={styles.section}>
          <strong>Example 3 TDS Deduction if the User Makes No Withdrawal Throughout the Year:</strong>
          <br />Let’s suppose a User with an opening balance of ₹3,000, deposit of ₹5,000, winnings of ₹15,000 and unutilised deposit balance of ₹1,000, has not made any withdrawal throughout the year. In such case, Net Winnings and TDS deduction will be calculated in the following manner:
          <br />Net Winnings = E + A – B – C – D, where,
          <br />Total withdrawal amount, A = ₹0, as user hasn’t made any withdrawal request
          <br />Total amount deposited by the user, B = ₹5,000
          <br />Opening balance at the beginning of the financial year, C = ₹3,000
          <br />Winnings from earlier withdrawals on which TDS has already been deducted, D = ₹0, as no withdrawal has been made
          <br />Closing Balance at the end of the financial year (Winning + Unutilised Deposit), E = ₹15,000 + ₹1000 = ₹16,000
          <br />Net Winnings = E + A – B – C – D
          <br />Net Winnings = ₹16,000 + 0 – ₹5,000 – ₹3,000 – 0
          <br />Net Winnings = ₹16,000 – ₹8,000
          <br />Net Winnings = ₹8,000
          <br />TDS = 30% of Net Winnings
          <br />TDS = 0.30 * Net Winnings
          <br />TDS = 0.30 * 8,000
          <br />TDS = ₹2,400
          <br />New Closing Balance = Closing Balance in the user account at the end of the financial year – TDS
          <br />New Closing Balance = ₹16,000 – ₹2,400
          <br />New Closing Balance = ₹13,600
        </p>
